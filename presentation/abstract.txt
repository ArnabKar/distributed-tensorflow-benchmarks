Distributed TensorFlow: A performance evaluation


TensorFlow is Google's open-source software library for Machine Learning.
Thanks to its portability and flexibility, it has become one of the most popular Deep Learning frameworks, both in industries and in research communities.
Recently, Google has released TensorFlow's distributed engine with the aim to reduce the long time required to train neural networks.

In this presentation, we firstly give a brief introduction to TensorFlow's programming paradigm.
Then, we introduce TensorFlow's distributed architecture and see how to easily extend single-machine code to run on an arbitrary number of machines.
Finally, we show TensorFlow's scalability in training Inception-V3 (a deep neural network) when using GPU-enabled nodes in Piz Daint and in Amazon EC2.
